## [G-01] Avoid contract existence checks by using solidity version 0.8.10 or later

Prior to 0.8.10 the compiler inserted extra code, includingÂ `EXTCODESIZE` (100 gas), to check for contract existence for external calls. In more recent solidity versions, the compiler will not insert these checks if the external call has a return value. 

For example: 

https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/AssetRegistry.sol#L2

## [G-02] Duplicated require() / revert() checks should be refactored to a modifier or function

Saves deployment costs.

For example: 

https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/p1/AssetRegistry.sol#L103 ,

## [G-03] Splitting require() statements that use && saves gas

Instead of using the && operator in a single require statement to check multiple conditions, using multiple require statements with 1 condition per require statement will save 3 GAS per &&. 

For example: 

https://github.com/reserve-protocol/protocol/blob/df7ecadc2bae74244ace5e8b39e94bc992903158/contracts/mixins/Auth.sol#L181 ,
