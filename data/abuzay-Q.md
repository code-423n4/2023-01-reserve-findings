## Vulnerability:
_register and _registerIgnoringCollisions are internal functions and not described in the contract.

## Impact:

The internal functions _register and _registerIgnoringCollisions are not described in the contract, making it unclear what their purpose is and how they are supposed to be used.
This can lead to confusion and errors in other parts of the system that rely on these functions.
It can also make it more difficult for external auditors and developers to understand and verify the contract's behavior.

## Recommendation:

Add proper documentation and comments to the internal functions _register and _registerIgnoringCollisions to explain their purpose and behavior.
Clearly describe the function signature, parameters and return values, and any other relevant details.
Consider making these functions external if they are intended to be called by other contracts or external users.
If the functions are not intended to be used outside of the contract, consider making them private to prevent accidental or unauthorized use.
Steps to Reproduce:

Look at the contract code.
Observe that the _register and _registerIgnoringCollisions functions are internal and not described in the contract.
Affected Version:
This vulnerability exists in the provided codebase with the version


Title: Incorrect data type used for "v" value in PermitLib library

Severity: Low

Description:
The PermitLib library, which is used for verifying metatx sigs for EOAs and smart contract wallets, uses the data type "uint8" for the "v" value in the "requireSignature" function. However, the "v" value of an Ethereum signature can be either 27 or 28, which exceeds the range of possible values for "uint8".

Impact:
This issue limits the range of possible "v" values, but it will not cause any security vulnerability or vulnerability in the function. The function will continue to work as expected in most cases, but it may return false results in rare cases where the "v" value is outside the range of "uint8".

Steps to Reproduce:

Use the PermitLib library in a smart contract
Call the "requireSignature" function with a "v" value that is outside the range of "uint8"
Observe that the function may return false results
Recommendation:
To fix this issue, the data type for the "v" value should be changed to "uint256" to allow for all possible "v" values. This change can be made in the "requireSignature" function of the PermitLib library.

Testing:

Test the PermitLib library after the modification with different range of v values and confirm it's working as expected.
Review the impact of modification on the overall smart contract.



Title: Lack of known vulnerability verification in PermitLib library

Severity: Medium

Description:
The PermitLib library does not check for known vulnerabilities before using it. This increases the risk of known vulnerabilities being present in the code.

Impact:
This issue may cause security vulnerabilities if the library is vulnerable to known attacks. An attacker could exploit a known vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the smart contract and steal funds, manipulate data or cause other unintended consequences.

Steps to Reproduce:

Use the PermitLib library in a smart contract
Check the library for known vulnerabilities
Observe that no verification has been done for known vulnerabilities
Recommendation:
To fix this issue, the library's known vulnerabilities should be verified before using it. This can be done by checking the library's version, reading the library's documentation, and searching for any known vulnerabilities online.

Testing:

Check the library for any known vulnerabilities and verify the library's version
Test the smart contract after verifying and make sure that it's working as expected
Review the overall impact of the library on the smart contract



Title: Lack of comments in PermitLib library

Severity: Low

Description:
The PermitLib library lacks proper comments that explain the purpose of the library and how it works. This makes it harder for developers to understand the code, especially when working with complex or unfamiliar libraries.

Impact:
This issue does not affect the security of the contract, but it can make it harder for developers to understand the code, which can lead to errors and bugs when making changes to the contract.

Steps to Reproduce:

Review the PermitLib library code
Observe that the code lacks proper comments
Recommendation:
To fix this issue, comments should be added to the PermitLib library to explain the purpose of the library and how it works. This can be done by adding comments to the function and variable declarations, and also by adding explanations of complex or non-obvious code.

Testing:

Review the code after modification and check that it's easy to understand and follow
Test the smart contract with the latest version and check if it's working as expected



Title: Use of older version of Solidity in PermitLib library

Severity: Medium

Description:
The PermitLib library uses an older version of Solidity. This increases the risk of known vulnerabilities being present in the code, as newer versions of the compiler include security updates and fixes.

Impact:
This issue may cause security vulnerabilities if the library is vulnerable to known attacks. An attacker could exploit a known vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the smart contract and steal funds, manipulate data or cause other unintended consequences.

Steps to Reproduce:

Review the PermitLib library code
Observe the version of solidity used in the library
Verify that the version used is older than the latest version
Recommendation:
To fix this issue, the library should be updated to use the latest version of Solidity. This can be done by updating the pragma statement in the library code.

Testing:

Verify the library after updating to the latest version of solidity
Test the smart contract and check if it's working as expected
Review the overall impact of the library on the smart contract
