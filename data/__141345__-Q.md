#### built in time units

```solidity
File: contracts/p1/StRSR.sol
37:     uint48 public constant MAX_UNSTAKING_DELAY = 31536000; // {s} 1 year
38:     uint48 public constant MAX_REWARD_PERIOD = 31536000; // {s} 1 year
```

There are built in time units of 1 years in solidity

#### return value not used

```solidity
File: contracts/p1/AssetRegistry.sol
80:         swapped = _registerIgnoringCollisions(asset);

156:         registered = _registerIgnoringCollisions(asset);
157:     }
```

Suggestion:
check the return value


#### Empty blocks should be removed or emit something

The code should be refactored such that they no longer exist, or the block should do something useful, such as emitting an event or reverting. 

```solidity
File: contracts/p1/RToken.sol
452:         try main.furnace().melt() {} catch {}
```
