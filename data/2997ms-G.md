|       | Issue                                    |
| ----- | :--------------------------------------- |
| GAS-1 | <x> += <y> costs more gas than <x> = <x> + <y> for state variables |
| GAS-2 | USE `REQUIRE` INSTEAD OF `ASSERT`        |
| GAS-3 |  ++I/I++ SHOULD BE UNCHECKED{++I}/UNCHECKED{I++} |

### [GAS-01]<x> += <y> costs more gas than <x> = <x> + <y> for state variables      
Using the addition operator instead of plus-equals saves gas

### [GAS-02] USE `REQUIRE` INSTEAD OF `ASSERT`

The `assert()` and `require()` functions are a part of the error handling aspect in Solidity. Solidity makes use of state-reverting error handling exceptions. This means all changes made to the contract on that call or any sub-calls are undone if an error is thrown. It also flags an error.

They are quite similar as both check for conditions and if they are not met, would throw an error.

The big difference between the two is that the `assert()` function when false, **uses up all the remaining gas and reverts all the changes made.**

Meanwhile, a `require()` function when false, also reverts back all the changes made to the contract but **does refund all the remaining gas fees we offered to pay**. This is the most common Solidity function used by developers for debugging and error handling.

### [GAS-03]  ++I/I++ SHOULD BE UNCHECKED{++I}/UNCHECKED{I++} WHEN IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO OVERFLOW, FOR EXAMPLE WHEN USED IN FOR- AND WHILE-LOOPS
The unchecked keyword is new in solidity version 0.8.0, so this only applies to that version or higher, which these instances are. This saves 30-40 gas per loop
